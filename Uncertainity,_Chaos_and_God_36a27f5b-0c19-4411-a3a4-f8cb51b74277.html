<h1 class="title">Uncertainity, Chaos and God</h1>
<p>
While watching a movie, I saw  a scientist who prayed to God for
the success  of the project  they were  working on. Now  I’m not
saying that it would be illogical for an scientist to believe in
God.  At many  times, I  have prayed  to some  entity that  I am
unable to define yet.
</p>

<p>
The question is  however, if given the chance  to that scientist
or    me   to    believe   in    God,   in    perfectly   normal
situation. Scientist  might have thought  it a waste of  time to
discuss on existance of God. Same with me, I rather have time to
waste, so I would have  outrightly rejected the existance of the
God and would have indulged in a debate with believers in God.
</p>

<p>
However, that changes when situation changes, both the scientist
and  me  wants an  understanding  of  whatever happening  around
us. Failure, on perfectly planned project is hard to concieve as
an understandable notion  and hence we can’t be  rely on science
to  be big  brother  and  make us  understand  why  the hell  it
failed. So we are left with the uncontrollables, that we want to
understand but at the time, we couldn’t. And hence, we introduce
a new entity that is higher  than the science, this doesn’t have
to be God, it could be  anything, a mosquito who is bothering me
at the  laptop screen can  be it, anything. For  that scientist,
it’s God, for me, well it’s still an entity indefinable.
</p>

<p>
The  entity is  rather illusion,  illusion of  control.  Control
where control  is not  possible.  And what  if this  illusion of
control   have   thier   rules,  constitution,   then   it’s   a
religion. But  what’s at the  center of religion, it’s  always a
God. Because what we need is not religion but a god, an illusion
of control.
</p>

<p>
Now every individual have their own imagination for their entity
or  God, while  this helped  to believe  that they  were in  the
control.   However   with  each  individual  came   a  different
imagination  and  a  different  God.   Different  representation
between sevearal  individuals might not be  productive when they
had to work  together for living, so at some  point of time each
illusion  of  control  merged  into  a  larger  and  general  to
population, illusion  of control.  Still the perception  by each
individual were the same.
</p>

<p>
This  served both  the purpose  as collective  of individual,  a
population had illusion of control that was symmetric to all and
the individual illusion of control still preserved.
</p>

<p>
In  a sense,  people who  believe in  God, has  two Gods,  their
common God which they share  with other people in the population
and their  own God which they  deny the existence, but  exist in
their mind as  an illusion of control. People  who don’t believe
in  God,  are  those  who  are  content  with  their  individual
God/entity.
</p>

<p>
So  as an  outcome of  evolution in  religion, Christianity  and
Islam chose the monoethist and Hinduism remained polyethiest but
at the individual  level, all of them  still remains polyethiest
having as number of Gods as the population.
