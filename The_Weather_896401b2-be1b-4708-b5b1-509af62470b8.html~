<h1 class="title">The Weather</h1>
<p>
The sky  today looked restless,  the clouds moving  swifter, the
blue changing into misty orange and then into dark and then back
to blue again,  as if the weather was mocking  my sadness soaked
heart throbbin  like a bad vericose.  I moved a little  and slid
myself under the blanket, the wind has fastened up.
</p>

<p>
I looked idly  at the bench ahead, where I  saw a couple leaning
on each  other, it occured  to me  then, this weather  must have
been  looking  lot  calmer  and   soothing  to  these  two  love
birds. Their  eyes were closed  but if  they were open  I betted
they were  filled with  love and happiness.   To them,  the cold
wind which was gushing into the park with speed of light, had no
impact. When you are in love, everything seems stagnant, the air
stops midway, the rays of light  caught in the air, the soothing
shadow of  the tree, and the  happy sound of Cukoo  in a forever
loop. Everything stops at the sight  of the love, and for me the
very same  feeling was  fading in the  blackhole, and  with that
feeling the blackhole  was drawing me in inch by  inch.  At that
moment, I  wished that I was  either of the couple  and enjoying
the  weather, the  cold wind,  and  the cukoo's  voice that  was
feeling irritating.   And for a moment  even, I felt that  I was
lying on  her lap like  the old  days, listening to  her soulful
playlist,  and in  between  humming, and  laughing, and  smiling
staring at her  slender and smooth face.  But, at  the very next
moment I saw the dark and  unforgiving sky, which looked like it
would pour down  anytime now.  And I knew that  it wouldn't as I
had the thought  a handful of times looking at  the heaviness of
the clouds.  And the heavyness  availed to nothing but more pain
for my eyes,  my heart, my lung and my  stomach.  I even forgot,
where it originated, where I felt  the first gush of pain, and I
tried so hard to remember it, in  a hope that if I would able to
find the origin,  I could send it back to  that blackhole again.
Again it was to no avail.
</p>

<p>
I  turned my  eyes  away  from the  scary  beast spread  between
horizons and looked at the couple once again. This time, I could
hear the breath they were taking, it was slow and steady, and it
occoured to  me they  were chasing each  other's breath  for one
time and  then slowing down to  let other catch up  on.  Even, I
saw  the wrinkle  that  passed  down man's  cheeck  to his  lips
symmetrically on either side, and for that particular moment, it
seemed  the man  was  older than  the woman,  who  had her  face
without signs of any unborn  wrinkles.  And then when I followed
her lips, to her nose to corner  of eyes, I saw a drop of water.
Finally I  thought it would  pour down any minute,  to challenge
the sky I looked up once  again, the darkness had prevailed, and
the white sun  had appeared from the veil of  clouds. It was not
water, it  was drop of  tear, which when  I looked again  at the
woman, was paving a way through  her smooth cheeks, and then the
second tear almost followed the  same path, both and many others
resting at the edge of woman's slender cheek-bones.
</p>

<p>
The man opened his eyes,  and unclutched his compainion from him
facing   the  very   cheeks  where   the  little   comotion  was
happening. He held  the woman's face in his hands  and wiped her
tears,  the woman  had still  her eyes  closed. "Open  your eyes
honey" The man spoke softly.
</p>

<p>
The woman was  unmoved without opening her eyes,  the tears once
again streamed down her cheeks. The man pulled her head close to
him, and rested it on his chest, wrapping his arm around her.
</p>

<p>
"It would be alright, I know it  can not be better as before but
you have  to stay, for the  sake of little Jinny,  she needs you
the most  right now"  I could  look at the  tear forming  in the
man's eyes, and man! I wanted him to cry. Cry like a little baby
but he  didn't. Instead he  continued his speech in  much softer
tone.  "I  don't want  you to  mourn me for  her sake.   Can you
promise me honey?"  I could hear  pulsating pain in the voice of
the man. "Can  you promise me honey ?"  This  time the man spoke
with little more effort.
</p>

<p>
The woman moved  her head in agreement and  hugged her companion
more tightly.  I was disturbed  and before I could understand, a
stream of tears flowed down through  my eyes, I let them flow, I
wanted to cry. Cry like a baby and that's what I did.  After few
minutes,  I felt  that  I couldn't  cry more,  I  opened my  bag
looking for a clothe to wipe out the tears.  There was no clothe
in the bag, I  used my forearms to wipe out  the cheecks, when I
felt a soft hand on my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you crying?" A voice which seemed of a kid, said.
</p>

<p>
I looked up and saw a  young girl standing upright with a flower
in her  tiny fingers and  a raw worried  look on face.  I didn't
know what to say but looking  at her, the words just spurred out
me like the tears I shred  a moment ago. "My girlfriend broke up
with me"
</p>

<p>
There  was a  confused look  on  her face,  ofcourse she  didn't
understand  what I  meant.   "What did  she  break?"  She  asked
innocently. "Was it a leg, was it your hand ?"
</p>

<p>
A  chuckle  came  out  of  my mouth.   "Oh  she  couldn't  break
anything. She is just a sweet  girl like you". I pressed my palm
over her cheek and said with a fresh sigh "It's just that we are
not together"
</p>

<p>
After a thoughtful  consideration, the face of  the girl changed
into  excitement. "Just  like my  father.  Mum  says we  are not
together" The little girl presented  me with the flower, she was
constantly  rotating in  her  hand.  "Here,  think  her as  your
girlfriend" She said gently.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to say many things, I  wanted to thank her, I wanted to
console her  that his  father would  come back  some day.  But I
couldn't speak more than few words. "It's beautiful"
</p>

<p>
"I have a  turtle at home, which  I talk to as he  is my father"
She said. "My mum, though doesn't like it"
</p>

<p>
"Where is  your mum?" I asked  with concern growing in  my mind,
and when I  looked at the where the girl  pointed her finger, my
stomach flipped for a moment.  A woman was sitting exactly where
I saw couple  few minutes ago, the bench however  was facing the
other side, I couldn't see her  face. But I knew exactly what it
looked like.
