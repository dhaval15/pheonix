<h1 class="title">Father (2020)</h1>
<p>
The movie  is about a person  who is having dementia  and how it
impacts  his  daugher's  life.   However, the  more  impact  the
dementia is on his life and the movie depicts how a person feels
when he can not make sense of  what he is feeling even though he
is trying his best to make sense of things.
</p>

<p>
The  director's approach  is very  unique and  is very  dramatic
style owing  to his  previous experience  in directing  plays. I
remember the music that comes before dwelling into each separate
scene before the father (Anthony Hopkins) removes the headphones
or plug off the disk, is  very immersive and takes us to journey
of an individual who is mercy at not his daughter but to his own
memories of his two daughters and his ownself.
</p>

<p>
The repeatative  dailogues in  some of  the scenes  captures the
viewer  what  an  individual   feels  while  observing  simmilar
situations and how ones tries his best to keep his mind sane.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Hopkins,  when he laughs  full-heartedly in some  of the
scenes is remiscinent of his old  self and then the final cry in
the room of  the hospital defines, how his life  has ended up in
sorry state.  And yet he starts  to live every morning  till the
world feels sane.
