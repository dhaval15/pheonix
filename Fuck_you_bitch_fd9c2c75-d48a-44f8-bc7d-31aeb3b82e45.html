<p>
A sudden knock  broke his dream.  It was heavy  knock but to his
ears it  seemed only a  gentle tap from  the back of  the middle
finger. He turned his side and  put the pillow, pressing hard on
his ears. The  knock came back again and if  he hadn't had drink
that night, he  would have heard a little noise  that came after
the knock.  The knocks disappered  when he pressed the pillow in
sort of way that one would press on one’s mouth who was supposed
to take the  last breath.  That was what he  murmured, under the
blanket. <i>Let  me take my last  breath</i>. The knock died  down, and
when Roy  recollected whole  incident the  next morning,  he had
only  heard three  gentle  taps and  nothing  else.  The  scream
before the thud on the door and after that nothing. He was drunk
to his throat that night.
</p>

<p>
In the morning,  the alarm broke his sleep, he  put his thumb on
the switch and turned it off.  Then slid under the warmth of the
blanket, the haze came and he slept until the next alarm.
</p>

<p>
The next time, it sounded even  louder, and when he slid out his
hand from the blanket, he tripped off it on the floor. Even from
the floor, irritating  shrill of the alarm was  pouring into his
ears the  same. That was  the hell of  the choice for  an alarm.
The low  pitch shrill that  can wake up  whole flat at  once.
</p>

<p>
He swayed his arm along the length of the bed, and only he could
feel was the  cold marble.  He flinched his arm  and pulled back
into the blanket.
</p>

<p>
The haze came back, and then  gone again when alarm didn't stop.
This time,  he threw the blanket  on the side and  rose.  It was
five and  seven, when he looked  on the mobile.  He  flashed the
mobile torch  on the floor, there  was it, the shiny  rim of the
alarm. <i>Why didn’t he threw  that away</i> he wondered before picking
it up and switching off.
</p>

<p>
The thought was so appealing, Roy  swinged his arm around bed to
throw it away  out of the window, never loosing  the grip on the
alarm.   For a  moment, he  even  felt that  the smooth  surface
brushed over finger and the alarm was at the ends of his finger,
and will  thrash the glass-window  any second. And yet  when the
swing ended, it felt right back in his palm, the coldness.
</p>

<p>
He turned on the bedroom light and put the bloody alarm beside a
photoframe.  The alarm  was the only thing that  remained of the
relationship that he hadn't crushed down or sent in a tapped box
at Riya’s house. And how bad had that turned out, not exactly as
he expected. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
Roy  turned  on  the  music  on  his  phone  and  got  into  the
bathroom. The booze hadn't weared off and he could realize while
watching his face in the mirror. The eyes were not red like last
night, but still the pinkish hue was there, reminding him of the
drinks he had the last night.
</p>

<p>
The reason behind  the booze he all remembered  clearly.  It was
just what happened after that  was blurred and hidden behind the
haze. The whole incident was replaying over and over against his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
He picked up the brush from the  shelf and put it into his mouth
and sat on the toilet seat.  He tapped on the forehead for three
times  and even  then  unsatisfied  he shaked  his  head to  and
fro.  It   didn't  help   get  off  the   hazy  images   of  his
head. Instead, his head fell on his lap.
</p>

<p>
And when he  woke up, he realized the toothbrush  was barren and
there wasn't  any paste on  it.  He  removed the brush  from his
mouth and flushed down the toilet. He opened the shelf again and
picked  up  the  toothpaste  and  saw  in  the  corner,  an  old
toothbrush  lying, <i>RIYAS</i>  handwritten on  it. He  picked it  and
threw in the dustbin below.
</p>

<p>
This was the last thing of  her. <i>And of course the bloody alarm.
Reminds me the morning and Reminds me mornings with her.</i> It rang
in his mind until he shaked his head again.
</p>

<p>
The taste of the toothpaste seemed  bitter on his tongue, but he
didn't care. He  was now awake enough to hear  the music, he had
put on  his phone. He  started moving  his legs without  much of
effort, sort of like those kids  who can’t pull their legs up or
move their waist,  they just up their arms in  the air and jumps
up and down without leaving the floor.
</p>

<p>
The toothpaste did work and the hazy images got off his mind. He
rinsed his  mouth, gargled  for good two  minutes and  wiped his
face.
</p>

<p>
"God Damn  you bastard" He  yelled when he  saw his face  in the
mirror. He hadn't shaved his face for a month now, the beard had
almost covered  half of the  face. If  his mother was  here, she
wouldn't have recognized  Roy. At this point of  time, Roy, half
drunk, didn't want to remember  his mother. She wouldn't approve
of either the alcohol or the long grown beard.
</p>

<p>
He jumped on  the bed and lied  down on his back,  his arms wide
open, his legs barely touching  the floor. His mind shifted back
to the events of last month how Riya had broken of with him, and
suddenly he was alone in the big apartment.
</p>

<p>
It was  the daily schedule,  after Riya  had left her.   Wake up
early and  get yourself  running. It was  under control  for two
weeks,  the same  fact  he started  doubting  now. And  suddenly
yesterday evening, when he saw Riya in the cafe taking sips from
the coffee mug, it all got out of control. <i>Fuck you bitch.</i>
</p>

<p>
Roy  got himself  a bottle  of vodka,  from the  store near  the
coffeehouse.   <i>Oh he  wanted to  say  hello to  her.  Fuck  you
bitch.</i> He  reached the apartment and  started drinking. Ordered
Pizza, kept drinking. He didn’t even remember when the pizza boy
came.
</p>

<p>
Halfway  through the  bottle, he  reached the  balcony and  lied
there for  good three hours,  the slices  settled in him  in and
just when  he started  feeling little bit  sober again.   He got
back in the apartment.  He finished  the half bottle in the next
hour. <i>Fuck you bitch.</i>
</p>

<p>
Then  it was  haze, in  his dreams,  Roy was  with Riya  for the
vacation  she always  wanted. At  Maldivs, her  slaying the  red
bikini, he got  her. Him in the havaain shirt  and cotten shorts
below. And when she came back  running from the sea all was gone
and it was all haze and  blurred and dark again. He couldn't see
anything, he could only hear gentle rthymatic clicks in his ears
and in between a girl singing in a mellow voice.
</p>

<p>
There was no  point get going on the running  track.  The bloody
alarm didn’t  think so.  He  opened his  eyes and stared  at the
alarm seating beside  his photoframe.  It hadn’t  lost its shine
over the  past two years.  <i>Same  couldn’t be said &#x2026;   Fuck you
bitch.</i>
</p>

<p>
Roy got on  his feet and hurried to his  wardrobe.  He threw one
t-shirt  and  a trackpant  on  his  shoulder  and got  into  the
bathroom. When he came out, he was all ready. Walking out of the
apartment, Roy's hand stopped at the door knob and he remembered
something.  Little  but important.  He  got  back and  tied  the
fitness band on his left wrist.
</p>

<p>
The band, Roy had bought on the next day when Riya left, it made
him  felt good  when he  was  up and  running the  next day.   A
productive day, he called and  checked on the calender. The same
calender he was  looking at now, thirteen days  had been checked
and add two more. Half a month. <i>Fuck you bitch.</i>
</p>

<p>
Roy turned the knob and opened the door. He gasped when he saw a
figure which  looked like a  girl, her  hairs were thick  in the
pool of  the blood which  strayed along  the door. "Oh  &#x2026;" The
blood was down to the door and had touched the rim around it.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he froze and  few hazy pictures flashed in front of
his eyes.  They were real, the sound was real but they wiped off
his eyes so quickly he couldn't make what it meant.
</p>

<p>
He shut  the door behind  the body,  his running shoes  left the
prints on the  floor, when he headed to the  bed.  He didn't see
it. Then his head started spinning, more than what it was before
when he was boozed. He sat on the edge of the bed and pulled out
his mobile.
</p>

<p>
<i>Call the police, you fool. Call the police.</i>
</p>

<p>
He didn’t. Instead, he closed his eyes and lied down on the bed,
with blood dripping from the shoes  on the floor. The dream came
back Riya  was running towards him  in the red bikini.   She was
laying  her hands  out  in  the air,  like  those old  bollywood
movies. Then  as if the  bikini was made  of some paint  the red
color flowed  down to her stomach,  down to her thighs.   And at
that  moment he  forgot  her  face.  <i>What  she  looked like  you
fuck. Don’t you remember, you loved her. You asshole.</i>
</p>

<p>
Roy jumped out of the bed and ran towards the door. He opened it
with a thump and looked at the  girl lying down on the floor. <i>Oh
fuck, that hair, how could you forget her hairs.</i>
</p>

<p>
He knelt forward  and turned her head in his  lap.  Her face was
dripped with the blood, but he knew  it was her.  <i>Oh Riya &#x2026; Oh
you fuck.</i> Then suddenly he felt  something on his arm, there was
wind blowing on  and off. The hairs moved on  his arm. He turned
her face and put a finger down  below her nose. He felt the warm
breath coming  out of her nose.  <i>How stupid are you!  Of course
she is alive, she can't be dead.</i>
</p>


<p>
"Help "  Roy put  Riya's head  with carefully  on the  floor and
screamed.  He  ran back  into the bedroom  and picked  his phone
up. <i>RIYA</i>.  The  call history popped out like a  needle but there
was no time  for it.  He dialed  108 and a stream  of tears came
rolling down his cheeks.
