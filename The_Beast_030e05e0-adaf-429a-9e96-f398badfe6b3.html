<h1 class="title">The Beast</h1>
<p>
I  grasped my  breath again  and locked  the door,  the constant
thudd on the door was immitating in me as a wave of fear. What I
wanted to do  was unmemorize those yellow  glowing eyes, instead
they started multiplicating and as  my fear multiplicated and at
that moment I  felt I was more scared when  the beast was behind
the door,  like anytime  I can  see his  claws ripping  the door
apart and then doing the same to my body. But then a few seconds
later I gathered myself, I realized I've to think quick, but the
slate against  my brain was  clear and  white.  I picked  up the
phone, and skimmed through the  contacts, my brother, my father,
whom would  I call, nobody. Then  a number which was  not on the
contact list, 100, but that was too risky, I would prefer myself
eaten  alive in  a single  day over  a prison.  I discarded  the
thought.
</p>

<p>
A powerful blow vibrated the door  as much that I thought it was
almost striped  from its hinges. And  as if now the  beast found
its voice,  it was growling  heavily, I suspected why  didn't it
howl earlier, but the next  thought didn't give space to earlier
one. What about my girls?
</p>

<p>
I skipped the steps while  climbing up stairs and almost flipped
upside down. I managed to  clutch the wooden railing and climbed
up the  stairs in a single  breath. Behind me I  closed the door
shut and checked it three times. I knew it was closed and I even
knew that the beast was getting stronger and stronger, and would
be  on  the other  side  of  the  door, growling,  taking  heavy
breaths, with its glowing yellow eyes. The thought of looking at
the beast's yellow  glittering eyes made me feel  dizzy and with
that state  of dizziness, I  lingered to the bedroom,  where the
girls were sleeping.   How in the heaven, they  were sleeping so
quitely.  I  picked both  of them and  marched towards  the main
gate,  but  when I  opened  the  door  and looked  outside,  the
blackness of  the long forest  that awaited, flipped  my stomach
upside down  and again I was  seeing a set of  yellow glittering
eyes, and I would have fell on the door itself, if it wasn't for
my youngest one, who woke up to all this comotion.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we going, daddy?" She asked.
</p>

<p>
This was getting  out of my control, with the  beast thumping on
the door  heavily, my little one  waking up and my  brain out of
ideas. The  noise of the  growl was becoming louder  and louder,
which now made my younger one cry  and then it woke up the older
one. At  that point,  I resented  all the choices  I made  in my
whole life.  My whole  life came  before me  like a  graded exam
paper where  in multiple choice  question I was given  zero. Why
did I  left the pharmacutical  company in the first  place?, Why
did I left my wife?, Why even  I brought these two kids into the
middle  of  nowhere or  to  this  earth?  And a  most  important
question which shoot my brain in burstful thinking.
</p>

<p>
The girls were crying heavily and trying to clutch away from me.
When I looked in  their eyes, it seemed to me,  if I hadn't held
them in my strong arms, they would have been running through the
forest without a flicker of fear  popping in thier eyes. At that
time, I got the answer, I would finish what I started.
</p>

<p>
I marched  back to the  bedroom, with the  girls in my  hand and
laid them  on the  bed. "Daddy wouldn't  let happen  anything to
you" I didn't  even stopped to listen to their  response, or the
cryings which  grew more  afterwards.  I couldn't,  I knew  if I
stopped there then  I wouldn't be able to stop  the beast. I ran
back to  the door which lead  to the basement, I  could hear the
screaming  growls  in  the  background  of  two  set  of  crying
shrills. I ran through the stairs and reached at the table where
phone was  lying idly. I didn't  even dare to look  at the door,
where the beast had probably scrached its claws.
</p>

<p>
I picked  up the  dial, and  until it  was connected,  I allowed
myself  to  bear the  pain  of  listening  to low  sobbing  that
pulsated my heart. Finnaly the call got connected.
</p>

<p>
"Mithilesh, come fast, call the police, call anyone you could" I
said and then sighed. "Take good care of the girls."
</p>

<p>
"Okay, but what?" A manly voice said.
</p>

<p>
"We don't have time for that" I  said and threw the dial back on
the rest. Now  I gathered the courage to look  at the door where
the beast  was thumping heavily  and fortunately there  was only
dent but no sign of tear. I turned right under the stairs, where
three iron safe  were laid, I pressed the code  for the last one
and the next second, it was open,  and there laid a pistol and a
special kind of knife, which  rotated itself when pressed on the
handle like a blade in a blender.
</p>

<p>
I took both out  and sat on the sofa, and  tried to force myself
into a zen mode,  where I could hear the breath  of the beast, I
could see  the movement  of each  pawn of  the beast,  the teeth
scritching  against  each  other,  the  raised  burrow  and  its
ears. And  its eyes  and its yellow  glittering eyes,  they were
terror and  I couldn't look  beyond those.  I couldn't  hear the
thuds, the  growl. It seemed I  was in the space  looking at the
blackhole.   And instead  of  absorbing all  the  light, it  was
emmiting bright yellow light and  was slowly pulling my concious
towards it, I was trying to look away but the very next moment I
was  looking back  at  the yellow  glittering  blackhole. I  was
starting  to resent  myself, if  I hadn't  had started  already,
there were so many questions  that lingered in my concious, that
I'd lost count of it.
</p>

<p>
And as I was pulled towards the yellow glittering lights, I felt
that there was a black circle inside the yellow ring, and it was
getting larger and larger. The glow started disappearing and now
I was  looking at the  eternal blackness,  I opened my  eyes and
read the sign on the board for  the last time.  DO NOT ENTER, it
said.
</p>

<p>
I pointed  the pistol at  the door,  and emptied all  the pistol
hoping  it  would be  burried  in  either  beast's head  or  its
heart. I didn't care for weather my hope availed or not. I threw
my pistol away and tightened my grip on the knife.
</p>

<p>
I turned the door open and  against my eyes the beast struggling
to  get on  its feet.   I wound  the door  behind me,  and there
looking into the beast's big eyes  I saw a reflection of myself,
not very unlike the beast itself. In its eyes I found the answer
for  my last  question, I  created the  beast cause'  I was  the
beast.
</p>

<p>
And with feeling of fulfillment I raged towards the beast.
